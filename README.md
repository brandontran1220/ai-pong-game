#### Single Player
In Single Player mode, after selecting your match, you can choose from three AI difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Each difficulty adjusts the AI's speed and reaction time, offering a tailored challenge. "Easy" is perfect for beginners or casual players, providing a slower-paced game. "Medium" offers a balanced experience, ideal for those seeking a fair challenge. For seasoned players, "Hard" delivers a fast-paced, competitive match where quick reflexes and strategic gameplay are crucial. This difficulty selection allows players of all skill levels to enjoy the game at their own pace.

#### Playing Screen
The playing screen features a classic Pong setup with a clean, minimalist design. The left paddle is colored red, while the right paddle is blue, each matching their respective player’s score displayed at the top of the screen. The scores are highlighted in the same color as the paddles, ensuring easy tracking of each player’s progress. A dotted white line runs vertically down the center of the playing area, visually dividing the two sides and adding a retro touch. The simple, color-coded elements create an engaging and easy-to-follow gameplay experience.
